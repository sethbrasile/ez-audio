!!ATTENTION!! If you have bought these samples from someone, you have been ripped. These samples are not for sale. Go find him and kick his ass.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

These samples are 100% raw. There is some proximity effect from the microphone (it was 40-50 cm away from the source at all times!), but more importantly, there is a lot of bass resonance coming from the floor and up into the mic.

When you build up your drumkit with these samples, do not forget to high pass these samples (as usual) to get rid of the unwanted bass. Keep in mind these are 100% natural, dry, unprocessed etc. recordings, so add effects and manipulate them as you wish.


Also, the samples are numbered and the lowest number represents the lowest veloctiy of the hit. For example if you are aiming for metal sound, the higher numbers are what you would want.

The hihats are struck with the tip of the stick for 2/3 of the sample amount, approximately. This means, if a hihat has 20 velocities recorded, like "Super_Cool_Hihat_Closed-01" to "Super_Cool_Hihat_Closed-20", approximately the sounds from 01 to 12 will be strokes with the tip of the drum stick, and from 13 and up will be the "side" of the stick, the standard way to hit cymbals in high volumes.
