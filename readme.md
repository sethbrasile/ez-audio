# EZ Audio

_Note: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! Not ready for use!!_

## Making the Web Audio API super EZ since 2024

EZ Audio is a lightweight audio library for the web. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a simple API for common audio tasks. It is written in TypeScript and has no dependencies.

EZ Audio was originally [Ember Audio](https://sethbrasile.github.io/ember-audio) and it was developed before vue and react rose to prominence. This is a full rewrite in vanilla typescript that will expose a similar-ish API to "Ember Audio"
